        <p>Based on a series of lectures given at <u>Cambridge University</u>, <u>Professor Hawking's</u> work introduced "the history of ideas about the universe" as well as today's most <b><i>important</i></b> scientific theories about time, space, and the cosmos in a clear, easy-to-understand way. <u>"The Theory of Everything"</u> presents the most <b><i>complex</i></b> theories, both past and present, of physics; yet it remains <b><i>clear</i></b> and <b><i>accessable</i></b>. It will enlighten readers and expose them to the <b><i>rich</i></b> history of scientific thought and the complexities of the universe in which we live.</p>
